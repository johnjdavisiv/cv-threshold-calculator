# Calculate threshold, CV, and VO2max paces

>By John J. Davis

Front-end UI and back-end calculations for estimating "threshold pace" (a.k.a. SSmax or maximal metabolic steady-state), "CV pace" (a.k.a. critical speed), and "VO2max pace" (a.k.a. vVO2max or slowest metabolically unsustainable pace) from race performances from 800m-10k. Provides best estimates and uncertainty ranges.  

These estimates are based on critical speed calculations applied to data from ~8,000 race performances from high school, college, adult, and master's athletes.
